    <h3>Bio</h3>
    <p>I currently go to school at Sunset Jr. High. I went to elementary at Ogden Preparatory Academy. My favorite classes are Orchestra, Math, and Geography.
    I try my best in school and work hard to get good grades. I also like to participate in school sports. The sports I do are Cross Country and Swimming. </p>

    <p>I have 2 sisters and their names are Caitlin and Carli. I also have two dogs, Coco and Penny. I really enjoy running, drawing, swimming, hiking, and really
    anything outdoors. I also love spending time with my family. When I am older I have a dream to travel the world!</p>
